== Project's Vision

* Run on Java Version 17
* Point Of Sales for (Small/Medium Retail Business). 
** Provide as integration with ERP such as: Idempiere; Apache OFBiz, 

=== UI & Business Logic

* Evaluate Pattern: Mode View ViewModel(MVVM), Model View Control(MVC)
* Compose for Desktop (Kolin DSL): 
** https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb
** https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/blob/master/tutorials/Swing_Integration
* OpenJX (XML)
** Supported on: Netbeans Platform 


=== Context

AppContext 

* Provide info abou current App Instance: provide b underline infra: OSGI; Netbeans Platform
** DI Container, etc...
** User (Provide info about authenticated User and permission's
** Host (Provide info about host running the POS)


=== Configuration 

File (Encr Password, KeyStorage, )

* Abstract Config Access (SHOULD be based on MicroProfile Config SPEC)
* Only database properties SHOULD be available on file (Properies File)
* database.1.url, database.1.username, database.1.password

Contextual Config on Database (KVP)

* AppConfig:
* HosConfig:


=== Resource 

APP Resource (Customization)

* Should not be stored on database anymore, but provided on specific jar and available on classpath
** on OSGI those resource can be easily updated as fragment of bundle kiolos-pos-resource

=== Tools for improvemen of Code Quali


GUI Test 

** FEST (Deprecate) use AssertJ (Swing Module)

Test Coverage with

* JaCoCo coverage tool, used to measure how many lines of our code are tested.
* OpenClover (code coverage tool for Java, Groovy and AspectJ)

Static Source Code Analysis with 

* PMD
* SpotBugs (Alternative to FindBug) and Find Security Bugs

Project has strict code style guidelines with

* Checkstyle maven-checkstyle-plugin 

Scan your Dependencies for Vulnerabilities with

* OWASP Dependency Check 
*** Dependency-Check is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool suite 
** https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/

Performance and 
 
* SoapUI (API Testing Tooling)
* Gatlin 
* JMeter
* Locust (Python Based)
